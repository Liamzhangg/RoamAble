# RoamAble | NewHacks 2025 Project

Kick off for our first hackathon: NewHacks 2025 held at the University of Toronto.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repo: `git clone <repo-url>`
2. Install dependencies for each part of the stack:
   - `front_end`: `cd front_end && npm install`
   - `back_end`: `cd back_end && npm install`
3. Run both services locally and iterate.

## Project Overview

- Generates optimal routes for people with accessibility issues or disabilities (*Currently only working in Toronto).
- Calculates path accessibility based on factors such as curb height, sidewalk presence, stair presence.
- User-friendly open map interface and customizable profile with easy signup and login (*Still in development).
